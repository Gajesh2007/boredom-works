# Thoughts at 30,000 Feet

There's something about being on a plane that makes me particularly reflective. Perhaps it's the disconnection from the constant stream of notifications, or maybe it's the perspective of seeing the world from above.

## Cloud Patterns

I spent at least an hour today just watching the clouds form and dissipate below us. The patterns they create are fascinating - like a constantly evolving abstract painting.

## Ideas I Had

1. A simple app that generates random writing prompts
2. A minimalist blog (which became this website!)
3. A new approach to solving that coding problem I've been stuck on

Sometimes all we need is a change of perspective to see solutions that were invisible before.
