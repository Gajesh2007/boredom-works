# Hello World

This is my first post on my minimalist blog. I created this space to share my thoughts and things I've explored while bored or on flights.

## Why I created this site

Sometimes the best ideas come when you're bored. This website is a collection of those thoughts, projects, and random explorations.

## What to expect

I'll be posting:
- Random thoughts
- Small coding projects
- Things I've learned
- Notes from my travels

Stay tuned for more!
